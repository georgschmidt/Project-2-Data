# Project-2-Data
Data clean-up and analysis for our meritocracy project.

When running the R-scripts on your devices, please comment out my file handling
lines (I mean all the lines including "C:\\...\\") and write a personal one.
Once you want to commit any changes, please delete your file handling lines and
un-comment my original ones such that there are no changes. Thank you!

There are a lot of #'s and this in on purpose! In R-Studio, when comments have
5 or more #'s, you can collapse all the following lines until the next comment
with 5 or more #'s appears. This should prevent a lot of mouse-scrolling.

D.RData is a complete Dataset
D_cont.RData only contains data from control group(s)
D_treat.RData only contains data from treatment group(s)
